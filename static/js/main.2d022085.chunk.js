"),a.a.createElement("p",null," Cellular Automata (CA) consists of a grid of squares called ",a.a.createElement("em",null,"cells"),", each of which contain a finite number of ",a.a.createElement("em",null,"states"),'. In binary-state cellular automata, a cell has two states, "dead" or "alive". After each generation, if a cell contains a number of alive neighbor cells as specified by the ',a.a.createElement("em",null,"survival rule"),', it will stay alive in the next generation. Otherwise, it will die (or in the case for multi-state CA, lose one state). For example, the famous Conway\'s Game of Life features a survival rule of "2,3" (an alive cell stays alive if it contains 2 or 3 neighbours, otherwise it dies), and a birth rule of "2" (a cell is born if it contains 2 neighbors), Similarly, if a blank (dead) cell on the grid contains a number of alive neighbor cells as specified by the ',a.a.createElement("em",null,"birth rule"),", an alive cell will be born in that location. A cell is usually defined to be a neighbor to another cell if it is one of eight cells surrounding it (in a 3x3 square) - this is called a Moore neighborhood. Alternatively, a von Neumann neighborhood defines a cell to be a neighbor if it is one of four cells directly adjacent to it (top, bottom, left, right)."),a.a.createElement("p",null,"There is incredible complexity that arises as a result of these birth, survival, and state rules that define cellular automata.
